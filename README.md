#### *datacompiler project*

*The purpose of this project is to be able quickly compile a set of test results.
This is accomplished by creating a local database of master and specific test items,
and then iterating through a set of test results to compile the data.*

##### Goals
The primary goals of the program are the following:
 - [x] Provide an easy method for the user to add new test items
 - [x] Keep track of test item ids
 - [x] Allow for easy selection of test results
 - [x] Provide clean format of compared test result summary

##### Python Knowledge
The required python knowledge needed to implement the datacompiler includes the follows elements:
 - import statements
 - file io
 - lists
 - dictionaries
 - conditional loops (if, for, while)
 - find

##### Functional Syntax
- `import` statements to include necessary libraries including `os` for handling file name inputation
 
- `with open(filename, 'r') as f` to read in existing files
  - Note: this structure will close the file automatically after completion

- `with open(filename, 'w') as f` to write to new files
  - Note: this structure will close the file automatically after completiion

- `f.read()` to extract information from a file and place into as a string variable

- `[]` for defining and creating lists of test ids

- `list.append(item)` to add items incrementally to an array

- `for each in list` to iteration through a list

- `if item in list` to check to see if a substring is included in a string

- `list.find(item)` to find the position of the matched string
  - Note: the purpose of finding the item location is associate a result field with a test item id tag
  - Example: `Item1: Result1` -- if we can find the location of the `Item1` tag, we now can search proximally to identify `Result1`

- dictionaries `{}` to keep insert and keep track of mapping the master ids to the specific test system ids
  - Note: the dictionary is also used as a data structure to collate the test results


##### Algorithmic Structure
Compilation of a mapping database is generated by comparing master items and specicic test system items.
With this information, we can create an index to look up the item id for each specific test system.
In order to create the index, we need the following:
- `Master Items` which contains the master test system ids and names
- `Specific Items of Test System(s)` which contain the specicic test system ids and names
- Identify the specific test system of each results file
- Gather the results and associate them with the master items
- Create a database of the organized information
